            <p>
              Kazi Nazrul Islam is the national poet of Bangladesh who is
              especially recognized as a Bidrohi Kobi (rebel poet) around the
              country. Nazrul is a famous poet, musician and philosopher of
              Bangladesh. The famous poet Nazrul's writings deal with the
              revolution of that period of the British government. His
              revolutionary attempt helped him to be a national poet of
              Bangladesh. He has raised his voice against any kinds of fascism
              and oppression and got popularity swiftly around the Indian
              Subcontinent.

            <p>
              Nazrul's writings explored themes such as love, freedom,humanity,
              and revolution. He opposed all forms of bigotry and
              fundamentalism, including religious, caste-based and gender-based.
              Throughout his career, Nazrul wrote short stories, novels, and
              essays but is best known for his songs and poems. He pioneered new
              music forms such as Bengali ghazals. Nazrul wrote and composed
              music for nearly 4,000 songs (many recorded as HMV and gramophone
              records), collectively known as Nazrul Geeti.
